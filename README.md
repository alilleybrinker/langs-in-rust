# Langs In Rust

This is a (probably incomplete) list of programming languages implemented in
Rust. It is maintained by the Ruse project as a source of inspiration and
comparison, and for others as a directory of potentially interesting projects
in this vein.

## Maintained Languages

- [Rust][rust]: Rust is implemented in itself.
- [Dyon][dyon]: Implemented by the Piston team. Dyon is a dynamically-typed
  scripting language that uses Rust's lifetime system rather than garbage collection.
- [Ketos][ketos]: A Lisp-like scripting and extension language. Compiles to bytecode
  which is then interpreted.
- [Rhai][rhai]: Rhai is an embedded scripting language for Rust.
- [Gluon][gluon]: Gluon is a small, statically-typed, functional programming language designed for application embedding.
- [rust-prolog][rust-prolog]: Rust implementation of prolog based on SML miniprolog
- [rtfort][rtforth]: Forth implemented in Rust for real-time applications.

## Unmaintained Languages

- [lang][lang]: A C-like language implemented for learning purposes.
- [embed_lang][embed_lang]: A compiler and virtual machine for a simple embedded
  language.
- [iron-lang][iron-lang]: A Lisp-like language, not to be confused with Iron, the
  Rust web framework.
- [rust-lisp][rust-lisp]: A minimal mix of Common Lisp and Scheme.
- [lisp.rs][lisp.rs]: `lis.py` ported to Rust.
- [radicle][radicle]: An Ur-Lisp interpreter based on Paul Graham's "Roots of Lisp"
  (_very_ old)
- [synthizer][synthizer]: A simple experimental functional language for real time additive audio synthesis.￼
